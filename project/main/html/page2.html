                    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                    <div class="text-block">
                        <p>2 1½"-thick New York strip steaks (about 1½ lb. total)
                            Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper
                            1 Tbsp. whole black peppercorns
                            2 Tbsp. vegetable oil
                            4 garlic cloves, 2 smashed, 2 thinly sliced
                            3 sprigs thyme
                            3 Tbsp. unsalted butter, divided
                            1 large shallot, finely chopped
                            ⅓ cup cognac, dry sherry, or brandy
                            ½ cup heavy cream
                            Flaky sea salt
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Preparation</h3>
                    
                    <div class="text-block">
                        <h5>Step 1</h5>
                        <p>Pat steaks dry with paper towels. Season all over with kosher salt and a generous amount of ground pepper. Let sit 15–30 minutes.</p>
                        <h5>Step 2</h5>
                        <p>Coarsely crush peppercorns with a mortar and pestle or place in a resealable plastic bag and crush with a small saucepan (they should be a lot coarser than ground pepper).</p>
                        <h5>Step 3</h5>
                        <p>Heat oil in a large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high. Cook steaks, undisturbed, until a deep golden brown crust forms underneath, about 3 minutes. Turn over and cook on second side until golden brown, about 3 minutes. If the steaks have a fat cap, stand them on their sides with tongs and cook until browned, about 3 minutes.</p>
                        <h5>Step 4</h5>
                        <p>Reduce heat to medium-low. Add smashed garlic cloves, thyme sprigs, and 1 Tbsp. butter to the pan. Cook, basting steak continuously, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of each steak registers 120°, about 2 minutes. Transfer steaks to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes.</p>
                        <h5>Step 5</h5>
                        <p>Meanwhile, combine shallot, sliced garlic, crushed peppercorns, and remaining 2 Tbsp. butter in skillet and cook, stirring often, until shallot and garlic are softened but not browned, about 5 minutes.</p>
                        <h5>Step 6</h5>
                        <p>Remove from heat and add cognac to pan. Set over medium heat and cook until cognac is mostly evaporated and spoon leaves streaks in skillet while stirring, 1–2 minutes. Add cream, bring to a simmer, and cook until sauce coats spoon, about 1 minute. Season with kosher salt.</p>
                        <h5>Step 7</h5>
                        <p>Slice steaks against the grain and transfer to a platter. Pour any juices from cutting board back into skillet and stir into sauce. Spoon sauce generously over steak; sprinkle with sea salt. </p>

                    <h2>Duck</h2>

                    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                    <div class="text-block">
                        <p>2 Gressingham duck breasts
                            2 large oranges
                            10 new potatoes, boiled in salted water and then cut in half
                            2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
                            Leaves from 1 bunch of thyme
                            120g honey
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Preparation</h3>
                    
                    <div class="text-block">
                        <h5>Step 1</h5>
                        <p>Pre heat oven to 180°C, Fan 160°C, Gas Mark 4</p>
                        <h5>Step 2</h5>
                        <p>Score the skin of the duck breasts and pat dry.</p>
                        <h5>Step 3</h5>
                        <p>Peel and segment one of the oranges and zest the other orange and squeeze the juice out. Set both aside.</p>
                        <h5>Step 4</h5>
                        <p>Place a pan onto a low to medium heat, season the duck with salt and place into the pan with no oil and cook for 6-8 minutes or until the skin is crisp and golden. Pour off any excess fat as you cook. Flip the breast over and seal the meat for 30 seconds.</p>
                        <h5>Step 5</h5>
                        <p>Place in a baking tray skin side up and place in the oven for 4 minutes.</p>
                        <h5>Step 6</h5>
                        <p>Meanwhile place the pan back onto heat and add in the honey, orange juice and zest, garlic and half the thyme. Reduce the sauce by half. Add in the potatoes and the orange segments and continue to simmer until loosely sticky. Set aside.</p>
                        <h5>Step 7</h5>
                        <p>Meanwhile remove the duck from the oven and glaze the skin generously with some of the pan mixture. Return to the oven for a 2-3 minutes if you like it rare (cook for a few minutes if you prefer it medium to well done), take out and allow to rest for at least 5 minutes.</p>
                        <h5>Step 8</h5>
                        <p>When you are ready to eat, bring the pan up to heat, divide the sauce and potatoes onto 2 plates. Carve the duck breast into 5 or 6 pieces and place on top, sprinkle over the remaining thyme leaves. Serve with your favorite greens.</p>

                    <h2>Pizza</h2>
                    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                    <div class="text-block">
                        <p>300g strong bread flour
                            1 tsp instant yeast (from a sachet or a tub)
                            1 tsp salt
                            1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling
                            For the tomato sauce
                            100ml passata
                            handful fresh basil or 1 tsp dried
                            1 garlic clove, crushed
                            125g ball mozzarella, sliced
                            handful grated or shaved parmesan (or vegetarian alternative)
                            handful of cherry tomatoes, halved
                            handful of basil leaves (optional)
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Preparation</h3>
                    <div class="text-block">
                        <h5>Step 1</h5>
                        <p>Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.</p>
                        <h5>Step 2</h5>
                        <p>Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</p>
                        <h5>Step 3</h5>
                        <p>Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.</p>
                        <h5>Step 4</h5>
                        <p>Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.</p>

                            2 fresh bay leaves
                            2 tbsp tomato purée
                            1 beef stock cube

                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Preparation</h3>
                    <div class="text-block">
                        <h5>Step 1</h5>
                        <p>Put a large saucepan on a medium heat and add 1 tbsp olive oil.</p>
                        <h5>Step 2</h5>
                        <p>Add 4 finely chopped bacon rashers and fry for 10 mins until golden and crisp.</p>
                        <h5>Step 3</h5>
                        <p>Reduce the heat and add the 2 onions, 2 carrots, 2 celery sticks, 2 garlic cloves and the leaves from 2-3 sprigs rosemary, all finely chopped, then fry for 10 mins. Stir the veg often until it softens.</p>
                        <h5>Step 4</h5>
                        <p>Increase the heat to medium-high, add 500g beef mince and cook stirring for 3-4 mins until the meat is browned all over.</p>
                        <h5>Step 5</h5>
                        <p>Add 2 tins plum tomatoes, the finely chopped leaves from ¾ small pack basil, 1 tsp dried oregano, 2 bay leaves, 2 tbsp tomato purée, 1 beef stock cube, 1 deseeded and finely chopped red chilli (if using), 125ml red wine and 6 halved cherry tomatoes. Stir with a wooden spoon, breaking up the plum tomatoes.</p>
                        <h5>Step 6</h5>
                        <p>Bring to the boil, reduce to a gentle simmer and cover with a lid. Cook for 1 hr 15 mins stirring occasionally, until you have a rich, thick sauce.</p>
                        <h5>Step 7</h5>
                        <p>Add the 75g grated parmesan, check the seasoning and stir.</p>
                        <h5>Step 8</h5>
                        <p>When the bolognese is nearly finished, cook 400g spaghetti following the pack instructions.</p>
                        <h5>Step 9</h5>
                        <p>Drain the spaghetti and either stir into the bolognese sauce, or serve the sauce on top. Serve with more grated parmesan, the remaining basil leaves and crusty bread, if you like.</p>

                    <h3>Preparation</h3>
                    <div class="text-block">
                        <h5>Step 1</h5>
                        <p>Melt margarine or heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat.</p>
                        <h5>Step 2</h5>

                        <h5>Step 5</h5>
                        <p>Option 1 - If you don’t have a steamer basket</p>
                        <h5>Step 6</h5>

                    <h2>Ratatouille</h2>
                    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                    <div class="text-block">
                        <p>2 eggplants
                            6 roma tomatoes
                            2 yellow squashes
                            2 zucchinis
                            2 tablespoons olive oil
                            1 medium white onion, diced
                            4 cloves garlic, minced
                            1 red bell pepper, seeded and diced
                            1 yellow bell pepper, seeded and diced
                            kosher salt, to taste
                            freshly ground black pepper, to taste
                            28 oz crushed tomatoes(795 g)
                            2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh basil
                            2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh basil
                            1 teaspoon minced garlic
                            2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley
                            2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves
                            kosher salt, to taste
                            freshly ground black pepper, to taste
                            4 tablespoons olive oil
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Preparation</h3>
                    <div class="text-block">
                        <h5>Step 1</h5>
                        <p>Preheat the oven for 375˚F (190˚C).</p>
                        <h5>Step 2</h5>
                        <p>Using a sharp knife or a mandoline, slice the eggplant, tomatoes, squash, and zucchini into approximately ¹⁄₁₆-inch (1-mm)-thick rounds, then set aside.</p>
                        <h5>Step 3</h5>
                        <p>Make the sauce: Heat the olive oil in a 12-inch (30-cm) oven-safe pan over medium-high heat. Sauté the onion, garlic, and bell peppers until soft, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, then add the crushed tomatoes. Stir until the ingredients are fully incorporated. Remove from heat, then add the basil. Stir once more, then smooth the surface of the sauce with a spatula.</p>
                        <h5>Step 4</h5>
                        <p>Arrange the veggies in alternating slices, (for example, eggplant, tomato, squash, zucchini) on top of the sauce, working from the outer edge to the center of the pan. Season with salt and pepper.</p>
                        <h5>Step 5</h5>
                        <p>Make the herb seasoning: In a small bowl, mix together the basil, garlic, parsley, thyme, salt, pepper, and olive oil. Spoon the herb seasoning over the vegetables.</p>
                        <h5>Step 6</h5>
                        <p>Cover the pan with foil and bake for 40 minutes. Uncover, then bake for another 20 minutes, until the vegetables are softened.</p>
                        <h5>Step 7</h5>
                        <p>Serve hot as a main dish or side. The ratatouille is also excellent the next day–cover with foil and reheat in a 350˚F (180˚C) oven for 15 minutes, or simply microwave to desired temperature.</p>

                    <h2>Grilled Salmon</h2>
                    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                    <div class="text-block">
                        <p>4 (6-ounce) salmon fillets or steaks, preferably skin-on
                            Kosher salt
                            2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus more to wipe down the grill
                            1/4 cup unsalted butter, room temperature
                            2 teaspoons chopped fresh dill
                            1 thinly sliced lemon, for garnish
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Preparation</h3>
                    <div class="text-block">
                        <h5>Step 1</h5>
                        <p>Remove the salmon from the refrigerator and sprinkle a little salt over it. Let it sit at room temperature while you preheat your grill for high, direct heat.</p>
                        <h5>Step 2</h5>
                        <p>While the grill is heating, mix the fresh dill with the butter in a small bowl.</p>
                        <h5>Step 3</h5>
                        <p>When the grill is hot, scrape down the grates with a grill brush. Pour a little olive oil onto a paper towel and use tongs to wipe down the grill grates.</p>
                        <h5>Step 4</h5>
                        <p>Coat the salmon in the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil and place it, skin side up, onto the grill grates. Grill over high heat for 2 to 4 minutes (depending on how thick your salmon pieces are) undisturbed.</p>
                        <h5>Step 5</h5>
                        <p>Carefully turn the salmon with a spatula. If using a gas grill, reduce the heat to medium. If using a charcoal grill, move the salmon to the cooler side of the grill.</p>
                        <h5>Step 6</h5>
                        <p>Cover and grill it for another 3 to 5 minutes, depending on how well done you prefer your salmon. The salmon should be just cooked through when done.</p>
                        <h5>Step 7</h5>
                        <p>To serve, place a few thin slices of lemon on each plate. Remove the salmon pieces from the grill (it's okay if the skin sticks to the grill grates) and place on the lemon slices. Top each piece of salmon with about a tablespoon of the dill butter and serve at once.</p>

                    <h2>Fish and Chips</h2>
                    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                    <div class="text-block">
                        <p>about 1 litre sunflower oil, for frying
                            2 thick skinless fillets of whiting, ling, pollock, haddock or cod (about 150g each)
                            2 large Maris Piper potatoes
                            1 tsp malt vinegar, plus extra to serve
                            75g self-raising flour, plus extra for dusting
                            25g cornflour
                            small pinch of ground turmeric
                            125g cold lager or fizzy water
                            4 cornichons
                            1 tsp capers
                            1 shallot
                            handful of parsley leaves, chopped
                            5 tbsp mayonnaise
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Preparation</h3>
                    <div class="text-block">
                        <h5>Step 1</h5>
                        <p>Cut the potatoes into chips and soak in cold water for 5 mins, then wash until the water runs clear. Tip into a pan of cold water with a pinch of salt and 1 tsp vinegar. Bring to a simmer, then turn down the heat and simmer gently for 10-12 mins until cooked through but not falling apart. Drain gently, then place on a tray in a single layer and chill until needed. Can be prepared a day ahead.</p> 
                        <h5>Step 2</h5>
                        <p>To make the tartare sauce, chop the cornichons, capers and shallot (finely chop if you prefer a smooth sauce), then combine with the parsley, mayo and a pinch of salt. Will keep chilled for up to 24 hours.</p> 
                        <h5>Step 3</h5>
                        <p>When you’re ready to fry, prepare the batter. Tip the flours and turmeric into a bowl with a pinch of salt, pour over the beer or fizzy water, and mix quickly until everything just comes together to the consistency of double cream – do not over-beat, a few lumps are fine. Keep chilled.</p> 
                        <h5>Step 4</h5>
                        <p>Pour the oil into a deep, wide pan like a wok, or heat a deep-fat fryer to 180C. If using a pan or wok, ensure that it is no more than two-thirds full with oil. Heat the oil until it is shimmering and carefully lower in the chips using a slotted spoon. Fry for 8-10 mins, gently stirring occasionally until golden and crisp. Transfer to kitchen paper to drain.</p> 
                        <h5>Step 5</h5>
                        <p>Put a little flour in a dish, then bring the oil you used to cook the chips up to 185C, if you have a thermometer, or until a drizzle of batter sizzles and crisps in less than a minute. Working quickly, dust the fish in flour, then dredge through the batter. Hold the fillet above the batter to let the excess drip back into the bowl, then carefully lower into the oil. Fry the fillets for a minute until the batter is just starting to set, then take a spoon and drizzle the fillets with extra batter to create an even crunchier, wispy coating. Fry the fish for about 4 mins, turning once, until deep golden and crisp. Lift onto some kitchen paper to drain for a minute, then serve with the chips, tartare sauce, and plenty of salt and vinegar.</p>

                    <h2>Pancakes</h2>
                    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                    <div class="text-block">
                        <p>½ cup granulated sugar(100 g)
                            ¾ cup brown sugar(165 g), packed
                            1 teaspoon salt
                            ½ cup unsalted butter(115 g), melted
                            1 egg
                            1 teaspoon vanilla extract
                            1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour(155 g)
                            ½ teaspoon baking soda
                            4 oz milk or semi-sweet chocolate chunks(110 g)
                            4 oz dark chocolate chunk(110 g), or your preference
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Preparation</h3>
                    <div class="text-block">
                        <h5>Step 1</h5>
                        <p>In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.</p>
                        <h5>Step 2</h5>
                        <p>Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.</p>
                        <h5>Step 3</h5>
                        <p>Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies).</p>
                        <h5>Step 4</h5>
                        <p>Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.</p>
                        <h5>Step 5</h5>
                        <p>Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</p>
                        <h5>Step 6</h5>
                        <p>Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.</p>
                        <h5>Step 7</h5>
                        <p>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown.</p>
                        <h5>Step 8</h5>
                        <p>Cool completely before serving.</p>

                    <h2>Chocolate Chip Cookies</h2>
                    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                    <div class="text-block">
                        <p>100g plain flour
                            1 tbsp golden caster sugar
                            2 large eggs
                            1 tbsp sunflower oil
                            300ml semi-skimmed milk
                            splash of beer, about 2 tbsp (optional)
                            100g butter
                            100g golden caster sugar
                            150ml freshly squeezed orange juice (about 12 large oranges)
                            2 tsp finely grated orange zest
                            1 tsp finely grated lemon zest
                            3 tbsp Grand Marnier
                            2 tbsp cognac
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Preparation</h3>
                    <div class="text-block">
                        <h5>Step 1</h5>
                        <p>Put the flour, sugar and a pinch of salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre, add the eggs, oil and 2 tbsp of the milk, and beat together with a wooden spoon until smooth. Slowly start to pour in a little milk, mixing as you pour, to keep the batter smooth. Pour in the rest of the milk, a bit more quickly now, until it looks like single cream. Finally, add the beer.</p>
                        <h5>Step 2</h5>
                        <p>Heat a 15cm/6in crêpe pan. Measure 21⁄2 tbsp of the batter into a jug, then pour into the pan, moving it around so the mixture swirls and fits the bottom of the pan. When the crêpe is golden underneath (in about 15 seconds if pan is the right temperature), turn and cook for a further 30 seconds, until spotted brown.</p>
                        <h5>Step 3</h5>
                        <p>Slide the crêpe on to a plate. Wipe the pan with oiled kitchen paper and continue frying until all the batter is used, stacking the crêpes on top of each other as you cook them. You can freeze the pancakes at this stage, wrapped in cling film and foil. Or make a day ahead, wrap and keep in the fridge. To reheat, put on an ovenproof plate, cover with foil and warm in a 180C/Gas 4/fan oven 160C for 10-15 minutes. (If using for Crêpes Suzette, warm through in the sauce.)</p>
                        <h5>Step 4</h5>
                        <p>TO MAKE CRÊPES SUZETTE - Make the crêpes as above.</p>
                        <h5>Step 5</h5>
                        <p>For the sauce, heat the butter and sugar in a deep frying pan (about 25cm/10in) over a low heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar begins to dissolve; turn up the heat and bubble quite fast, until the mixture just starts to go brown and caramelise (about 4 minutes), stirring only towards the end. Pour in the orange juice (see left); add the orange and lemon zests, letting the mixture bubble for 3-4 minutes to thicken slightly. Add the Grand Marnier and cognac, heat for a few seconds and lower the heat.</p>
                        <h5>Step 6</h5>
                        <p>Put one crêpe into the juices and, holding it with a fork, coat it well in the mixture. Fold it into quarters and push to one side of the pan. Continue the coating and folding with the remaining pancakes. Serve 2-3 crêpes per person with the sauce.</p>
